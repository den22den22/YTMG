**YTMG** is a Telegram userbot that utilizes `ytmusicapi` and `yt-dlp` to conveniently search, view information about, and download music and albums from YouTube Music directly into your Telegram chat.

*   **pip:** To install Python dependencies.
*   **FFmpeg:** **Required** for downloading audio, embedding metadata, and cover art. It must be installed on your system and available in the `PATH` environment variable, or the full path to the executable must be specified in `dlp.conf`.

## Installing FFmpeg

`FFmpeg` is a critical dependency for most download features. Install it using your system's package manager:

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```
*   **Arch Linux/Manjaro:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu ffmpeg
    ```
*   **Fedora:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install ffmpeg
    ```
*   **macOS (using Homebrew):**
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```
*   **Windows:**
    1.  Download a build from the official [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) site (e.g., from gyan.dev or BtbN).
    2.  Extract the archive.
    3.  Add the path to the `bin` folder inside the extracted archive to your system's `PATH` variable, or specify the full path to `ffmpeg.exe` in the `ffmpeg_location` parameter of `dlp.conf`.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/den22den22/YTMG.git
    cd YTMG
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Telegram API:**
    *   Obtain your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Do not hardcode them into the script! The bot expects them as **environment variables**. Set the `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` variables in your system before running the bot.
        *   *Example for Linux/macOS (temporary session):*
            ```bash
            export TELEGRAM_API_ID=1234567
            export TELEGRAM_API_HASH='abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890'
            python main.py
            ```
        *   *Recommended:* Use a `.env` file and a library like `python-dotenv` (if you modify the code) or configure environment variables at the system/service level.

4.  **YTMusic Authentication (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To access private playlists, liked songs, recommendations, history, and other content requiring a YouTube Music account login, you need to create a `headers_auth.json` file.
    *   Follow the **official `ytmusicapi` instructions**: [Setup using a browser](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/browser.html).
    *   Place the generated `headers_auth.json` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
    *   If this file is missing, the bot will operate in unauthenticated mode (functionality will be limited to public content).

5.  **Bot Configuration (`UBOT.cfg`):**
    *   Copy the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp UBOT.cfg.example UBOT.cfg
        ```
    *   Edit `UBOT.cfg` according to your preferences. See the comments in the `UBOT.cfg.example` file for details on each parameter.

6.  **yt-dlp Configuration (`dlp.conf`):**
    *   Copy the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp dlp.conf.example dlp.conf
        ```
    *   Edit `dlp.conf` if necessary. This file allows fine-tuning of how `yt-dlp` downloads and processes files. See the comments in the `dlp.conf.example` file and the official `yt-dlp` documentation for details.

7.  **.gitignore:**
    *   A `.gitignore` file is included in the repository to prevent accidental committing of sensitive files (like `telegram_session.session`, `headers_auth.json`), logs, and temporary download files. Ensure this file is present and contains appropriate entries.

## Running the Bot

1.  Ensure you are in the directory containing `main.py`.
2.  Make sure the `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` environment variables are set.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  On the first run, Telethon will prompt you to log in to your Telegram account (enter phone number and confirmation code). A session file (`telegram_session.session`) will be created to avoid logging in every time. **Never share this file!**
5.  For running in the background, using `screen` or `tmux` is highly recommended:
    ```bash
    # Example using screen
    screen -S ytmgbot # Create a screen session
    # Set environment variables if needed
    export TELEGRAM_API_ID=...
    export TELEGRAM_API_HASH=...
    python main.py
    # Detach from session: Ctrl+A, then D
    # Re-attach: screen -r ytmgbot
    ```
