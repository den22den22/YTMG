## Requirements

*   **Python:** 3.8 or higher (3.10+ recommended).
*   **Git:** To clone the repository.
*   **pip:** To install Python dependencies.
*   **FFmpeg:** **Required** for downloading audio, embedding metadata, and cover art. It must be installed on your system and available in the `PATH` environment variable, or the path to it must be specified in `dlp.conf`.

---

## Installing FFmpeg

`FFmpeg` is a critical dependency. Install it using your system's package manager:

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```
*   **Arch Linux/Manjaro:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu ffmpeg
    ```
*   **Fedora:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install ffmpeg
    ```
*   **macOS (using Homebrew):**
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```
*   **Windows:**
    1.  Download a build from the official [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) site (e.g., from gyan.dev or BtbN).
    2.  Extract the archive.
    3.  Add the path to the `bin` folder inside the extracted archive to your system's `PATH` variable, or specify the full path to `ffmpeg.exe` in the `ffmpeg_location` parameter of `dlp.conf`.

---

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/den22den22/YTMG.git
    cd YTMG
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Telegram API:**
    *   Obtain your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Do not hardcode them into the script! The bot expects them as **environment variables**. Set the `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` variables in your system before running the bot.
        *   *Example for Linux/macOS (temporary session):*
            ```bash
            export TELEGRAM_API_ID=1234567
            export TELEGRAM_API_HASH='abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890'
            python main.py
            ```
        *   *Recommended:* Use a `.env` file and a library like `python-dotenv` (if you modify the code) or configure environment variables at the system/service level.

4.  **YTMusic Authentication (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To access private playlists, liked songs, recommendations, history, and other content requiring a YouTube Music account login, you need to create a `headers_auth.json` file.
    *   Follow the **official `ytmusicapi` instructions**: [Setup using a browser](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/browser.html).
    *   Place the generated `headers_auth.json` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
    *   If this file is missing, the bot will operate in unauthenticated mode (functionality will be limited to public content).

5.  **Bot Configuration (`UBOT.cfg`):**
    *   Copy the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp UBOT.cfg.example UBOT.cfg
        ```
    *   Edit `UBOT.cfg` according to your preferences:
        *   `prefix`: Command prefix (e.g., `,`).
        *   `whitelist_enabled`: `true` to enable the whitelist, `false` to allow everyone to use the bot.
        *   `bot_credit`: Caption text for sent files. Supports Markdown for links (e.g., `"via [YTMG](https://github.com/den22den22/YTMG/)"`). Ensure you set `parse_mode='md'` in the sending code if using links (currently handled by the bot).
        *   `auto_clear`: `true` to automatically clear old bot messages.
        *   Other parameters: See the file and comments in `main.py` (`DEFAULT_CONFIG` section).

6.  **yt-dlp Configuration (`dlp.conf`):**
    *   Copy the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp dlp.conf.example dlp.conf
        ```
    *   Edit `dlp.conf` if necessary. Key parameters:
        *   `format`: Preferred audio/video format (see `yt-dlp` documentation). Default is `bestaudio/best`.
        *   `postprocessors`: Post-processing settings (conversion, embedding metadata/thumbnails).
            *   **ATTENTION:** Do not remove sections with keys `FFmpegExtractAudio`, `EmbedMetadata`, `EmbedThumbnail` if you want the bot to convert audio and embed metadata/thumbnails.
            *   `preferredcodec`, `preferredquality`: Codec and quality settings for `FFmpegExtractAudio`.
        *   `outtmpl`: Template for the output file path. Defaults to saving in the bot's directory.
        *   `ffmpeg_location`: Uncomment and provide the full path to `ffmpeg` if it's not in your `PATH`.

7.  **Whitelist (`users.csv`):**
    *   If `whitelist_enabled` is set to `true`, create a `users.csv` file in the bot's directory.
    *   Add users in the format `Name;UserID` (one user per line). You can find a user's ID using bots like `@userinfobot`.
    *   The name is used for display purposes in the `,list` command.

8.  **.gitignore:**
    *   A `.gitignore` file is included in the repository to prevent accidental committing of sensitive files (like `telegram_session.session`, `headers_auth.json`), logs, and temporary download files.

## Running the Bot

1.  Ensure you are in the directory containing `main.py`.
2.  Make sure the `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` environment variables are set.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  On the first run, Telethon will prompt you to log in to your Telegram account (enter phone number and confirmation code). A session file (`telegram_session.session`) will be created to avoid logging in every time. **Never share this file!**
5.  For running in the background, using `screen` or `tmux` is recommended:
    ```bash
    # Example using screen
    screen -S ytmgbot # Create a screen session
    # Set environment variables if needed
    export TELEGRAM_API_ID=...
    export TELEGRAM_API_HASH=...
    python main.py
    # Detach from session: Ctrl+A, then D
    # Re-attach: screen -r ytmgbot
    ```
